A is a sorted list of n different elements in ascending order.
Consider A = [10,23,36,37,47,59,64,71] for example.
Using python language specific syntax, determine if a given element
is contained in the list, A.

A  shift  of  a  sorted  array  by k,
means  removing  the  last k elements and placing them at the beginning.

For example, if A=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k= 3 then new A = [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].
Given a sorted list A that  has  been  shifted  by  an  unknown k,
give  an O(n) algorithm to find k

try to implement this with O(log(n)) algorithm

Find the Nth number in Fibonacci sequence.

A Fibonacci sequence is defined as follow:

The first two numbers are 0 and 1.
The i th number is the sum of i-1 th number and i-2 th number.
The first ten numbers in Fibonacci sequence is:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ...

Example
Given 1, return 0

Given 2, return 1

Given 10, return 34

Notice
The Nth fibonacci number won't exceed the max value of signed 32-bit integer in the test cases.

'''

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

For example,
Given s = "the sky is blue",
return "blue is sky the".

Clarification
What constitutes a word?
A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
Could the input string contain leading or trailing spaces?
Yes. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
How about multiple spaces between two words?
Reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.

'''
Reverse a 3-digit integer.

Example
Reverse 123 you will get 321.

Reverse 900 you will get 9.

Notice
You may assume the given number is larger or equal to 100 but smaller than 1000.
